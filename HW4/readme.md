(a) Fit the data set provided in the folder with an absorbed power-law spectrum and find the best fitting total NH and power-law index (the total NH= Milky Way_NH + intrinsic NH). 

(b)This is the Swift-XRT spectrum of a Gamma Ray Burst GRB081028. The coordinates are: RA=08 07 34.9 dec=+02 18 31.0. We will first assume that the source is at redshift z=0. What is the amount of intrinsic NH (i.e. the NH component that is due to absorption outside the Milky Way -mostly due to absorption in the transient host galaxy-)?

(c) The actual redshift of GRB081028 is z=3.038. Re-write your code to account for the non-zero redshift of the source and re-calculate the intrinsic NH. What do you find?
